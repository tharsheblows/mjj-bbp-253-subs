# MJJ bbP 2.5.3 Subs

This is simply a plugin with the subscription functions from bbPress 2.5.3. They send one user at a time, so might substantially slow down the posting process, although I think it varies by host and how they handle these sorts of emails. (This is the reason it was changed to bcc'ing in all subscribers at once in the first place.)
